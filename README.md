<h3 align="center">Offensive Cybersecurity Consultant</h3>
<br>

Consultant with two decades of mastery in Offensive Cybersecurity, malware development & strategic cyber maneuvers. My journey, marked by an unquenchable thirst for mastering the art of cyber warfare, has led me to orchestrate many audacious offensive campaigns that not only expose vulnerabilities but empower organizations with the insights necessary to fortify their environment. My two decades of hands-on experience have been instrumental in curating a comprehensive repertoire of strategies that challenge conventional norms & policies.

I hold a profound fascination for efficiency-driven software and workflow enhancement. My objective is to maximize daily productivity driven by a genuine passion for the field of computer science. Nevertheless, I advocate for a balanced approach between work and personal life. I reject the notion of relentless grind. Contemporary society often overemphasizes the concept of ceaseless toil, neglecting the journey itself.

ðŸ’— I love my family, I'm more efficient so I get to spend more time with them.

My contributions on GitHub and GitLab tend to be discreetly housed within proprietary repositories (sorry). I have very limited engagement with open source projects. As time progresses and I aspire to establish a more prominent public footprint (on X as an example), I will increasingly engage in Open Source initiatives to show the general public my skillset.
